# Topic Application

## Topic 1
* **Merit**: is the topic intellectually challenging?

  Our efforts to use medical data has merit in the regard that it attempts to solve real-world problems that healthcare personnel are concerned with and need to know more about to better provide for patients. Additionally, the nature of the project makes it extendible to other use cases in a way that it can be integrated with other data. At an academic level, we expect to work with data to answer questions that have not been answered before and have the potential to greatly impact the future of healthcare.
    
* **Novelty**: is there already a knowledge graph for this topic?

  There is not a currently existing knowledge graph... Since several of these questions remain unanwered,

  * solves a real world problem
  * researchers in other domains care
  * disparate information, the data we have is extendible to out use cases and integration with other data
    
* **Timeliness**: does creating a knowledge graph for this topic address a current event or important (unsolved) problem?
* **Audience**: broadly, who would be interestd in a knowledge graph for this topic?
