# Topic Application

## Topic 1
* **Merit**: is the topic intellectually challenging?

  Our efforts to use medical data has merit in the regard that it attempts to solve real-world problems that healthcare personnel are concerned with and need to know more about to better provide for patients. Additionally, the nature of the project makes it extendible to other use cases in a way that it can be integrated with other data. At an academic level, we expect to work with data to answer questions that have not been answered before and have the potential to greatly impact the future of healthcare.
    
* **Novelty**: is there already a knowledge graph for this topic?
  
  Several of the questions that are of interest to our medical collaborators are primarily focused on how sociodemographic factors influence patient outcomes for different diagnoses. While there are a number of pre-existing medical KGs, they do not directly address these concerns. Many existing KGs focus on issues such as mapping out specific biochemical features of diseases, potential treatments, or symptoms. Our problem is focused on examining how records for existing patients, as well as hospital records from various departments, are related. There are several existing medical KGs that can potentially provide information about both generating synthetic data and for how our KGs should be structured. These include the ICD10 ontology, ontologies that map out high level attributes of diseases, and pre-existing medical terminology and subject header KGs (all linked below).

Existing KGs:
- ICD10: https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ICD10CM
- Disease ontologies:
	- MONDO: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/mondo
	- https://disease-ontology.org/do
	- https://disease-ontology.org/do-kb
- UMLS: https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/uts/umls/semantic-network/T071

- MeSH Medical subject header: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html
    
* **Timeliness**: does creating a knowledge graph for this topic address a current event or important (unsolved) problem?

  Our goal is to address unanswered questions about trends over time and sociodemographic factors and their relations to healthcare. A knowledge graph on this topic would allow healthcare to be better tailored to the patient based on prior knowledge about their condition and sociodemographic factors.
  
* **Audience**: broadly, who would be interested in a knowledge graph for this topic?

  Healthcare personnel would be particularly interested in a knowledge graph on this topic, as it would allow them to identify trends, make predictions about patient conditions, and ultimately provide better care for patients. Patients, being indirectly affected by information obtained from the knowledge graph, would also be interested in its application.
